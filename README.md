A flow-matching framework for efficient medical image translation.
- ✅ Inference with flexible Euler steps without retraining
- ✅ Bidirectional translation (forward/backward) with a single unified network

Our work is currently under review for [ICASSP 2026](https://2026.ieeeicassp.org/).  
More related training and inference files will be released upon acceptance.
