A flow-matching framework for efficient medical image translation (segmentation).
- ✅ Inference with flexible Euler steps without retraining
- ✅ Bidirectional translation (forward/backward) with a single unified network

1. Our work "ArbitraryFlow: Towards One Step Generative Biomedical Image Segmentation" has been accepted in BIBM2025.

2. Our work on brain image transltion is currently under review for [ICASSP 2026](https://2026.ieeeicassp.org/).  
More related training and inference files will be released upon acceptance.
