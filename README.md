A flow-matching framework for efficient medical image translation (segmentation).
- ✅ Inference with flexible Euler steps without retraining
- ✅ Bidirectional translation (forward/backward) with a single unified network

1. Our work "ArbitraryFlow: Towards One Step Generative Biomedical Image Segmentation" has been accepted (regular paper) in [BIBM2025](https://biod.whu.edu.cn/bibm2025/).

2. Our work on brain image translation is currently under review for [ICASSP 2026](https://2026.ieeeicassp.org/).
